 	<h2>Climbing, my favorite sport !</h2>
 	<p>
 		I really love climbing, that's my passion. I've developed a keen sense of reflection and patience through climbing, where this is paramount and allows you to understand the satisfaction of hard work but also how sport works the mind and body through the same prism.

 	<h2>The beauty of art</h2>
 	<p>
 		 For me, art is really important, because it shows the beauty of the world trough different angles such as music, fashion, etc. It makes me feel alive.
